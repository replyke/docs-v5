## Entity Object Documentation

The **Entity** object represents a core item within Replyke. It can model anything from a social media post or product listing to a static page or location-based record. It supports rich metadata, votes, mentions, optional location tagging and more.

### Integration Notes

* The `Entity` structure is intentionally flexible for integration into varied content pipelines, including static, dynamic, or externally referenced data.
* `foreignId` enables mapping to external datasets without requiring UUIDs.
* `attachments`, `metadata`, and `location` provide extensibility without schema changes.
