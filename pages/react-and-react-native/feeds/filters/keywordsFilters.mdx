### Keywords Filters

The **Keywords Filters** in Replyke allow developers to filter entities in a feed based on keywords. This filtering mechanism provides a way to include or exclude entities whose keywords match specific criteria. Let’s dive into how it works and how you can utilize it effectively.

#### **Overview of Keywords Filters**

The `keywordsFilters` property can be passed to the `FeedProvider` as an object with the following structure:

```typescript
export interface KeywordsFilters {
  includes?: string[];
  doesNotInclude?: string[];
}
```

-   **`includes`**: Specifies keywords that must be present in an entity’s keywords array for it to be included in the feed.
-   **`doesNotInclude`**: Specifies keywords that must not be present in an entity’s keywords array for it to be included in the feed.

You can dynamically update these filters using the `updateKeywordsFilters` function provided by the `useFeed` hook.

#### **Dynamically Updating Keywords Filters**

The `updateKeywordsFilters` function allows developers to modify the state of the keywords filters. It provides three actions:

1.  **`add`**: Adds new keywords to the specified list (`includes` or `doesNotInclude`).
2.  **`remove`**: Removes specified keywords from the list.
3.  **`reset`**: Resets the specified list to its initial state. You can reset both lists simultaneously.
4. **`replace`**: Replaces the entire array of keywords with a new set. For example:

> Important**: When calling `updateKeywordsFilters("add", "both", ...)` or `updateKeywordsFilters("replace", "both", ...)`, no action is taken, as adding/replacing across both lists simultaneously is not supported.  


Here is an example of how to use `updateKeywordsFilters`:

```tsx
const { updateKeywordsFilters } = useFeed();

// Adding a keyword to the includes list
updateKeywordsFilters("add", "includes", "React");

// Removing a keyword from the doesNotInclude list
updateKeywordsFilters("remove", "doesNotInclude", "Vue");

// Resetting both lists
updateKeywordsFilters("reset", "both");

// Replacing the includes array with a new array
updateKeywordsFilters("replace", "includes", ["Angular"]); 
```

#### **How Keywords Filters Work**

When the feed is queried, the keywords filters are applied as follows:

1.  **Includes**: If the `includes` array contains keywords, only entities whose `keywords` property contains all these keywords will be included in the feed.
2.  **Does Not Include**: If the `doesNotInclude` array contains keywords, entities whose `keywords` property contains any of these keywords will be excluded from the feed.
3.  **Combined**: When both `includes` and `doesNotInclude` are specified, entities must satisfy both conditions—they must include all keywords from `includes` and exclude all keywords from `doesNotInclude`.

#### **Example Use Cases**

##### **Passing Static Filters to the FeedProvider**

If you want to set static filters as a starting point for your feed, you can pass them directly into the `FeedProvider`:

```tsx
<FeedProvider
  keywordsFilters={{ includes: ["JavaScript", "React"], doesNotInclude: ["Angular"] }}
>
  <MyFeedComponent />
</FeedProvider>
```

This setup ensures that the feed is pre-configured to show only posts about "JavaScript" or "React" while excluding posts that mention "Angular."

##### **Dynamically Updating Filters Based on User Interaction**

To dynamically change the filters, such as when a user clicks a keyword button, use the `updateKeywordsFilters` function from the `useFeed` hook:

```tsx
const { updateKeywordsFilters, infusedEntities, loadMore } = useFeed();

const handleKeywordClick = (keyword: string) => {
  updateKeywordsFilters("add", "includes", keyword);
};

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Filtered Blog Posts</h1>
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => handleKeywordClick("JavaScript")}>JavaScript</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleKeywordClick("React")}>React</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleKeywordClick("Angular")}>Exclude Angular</button>
    </div>
    <ul>
      {infusedEntities.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.referenceId}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
    <button onClick={loadMore}>Load More</button>
  </div>
);
```

In this example, clicking a button dynamically updates the feed by adding a keyword to the `includes` filter.

#### **Important Notes**

-   The filter updates are applied immediately and reset the feed to ensure that the updated filter conditions are reflected in the data.
-   Invalid or empty keyword values are ignored.
-   Combining `includes` and `doesNotInclude` provides a powerful mechanism for fine-tuning the feed results.

#### **Conclusion**

The Keywords Filters offer a flexible way to include or exclude entities based on their associated keywords. By leveraging the `keywordsFilters` property and the `updateKeywordsFilters` function, you can dynamically tailor the feed to meet your application’s needs. Whether you’re building a blogging platform, an e-commerce site, or a custom app, this filter can help you surface the most relevant content for your users.
