### Location Filters

#### Overview
The Location Filters feature in Replyke allows users to filter entities within a specified radius of a given geographic coordinate. This is particularly useful for applications that involve location-based content, such as local events, businesses, or nearby user posts. With Location Filters, users can narrow down their feed to display only entities relevant to a specific location.

#### How It Works
The `locationFilters` prop is used to define the geographic filter parameters. The filter expects an object of type `LocationFilters`, which contains the latitude, longitude, and radius (in meters) to define the area of interest.

```typescript
interface LocationFilters {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  radius: number;
}
```

This object can be provided directly to the `FeedProvider` component to apply static location filtering during initialization. To dynamically adjust the location filters after initialization, the `useFeed` hook provides the `setLocationFilters` method.

```typescript
setLocationFilters: (location: LocationFilters | null) => void;
```

- Setting the filters to `null` removes the location-based filtering.
- Providing valid `latitude`, `longitude`, and `radius` values updates the filter dynamically.

#### Example Usage

##### Static Location Filters
To initialize the feed with location filters:

```tsx
const locationFilters = {
  latitude: 37.7749,
  longitude: -122.4194,
  radius: 5000, // 5 km
};

<FeedProvider locationFilters={locationFilters}>
  {/* Your feed content here */}
</FeedProvider>;
```

##### Dynamic Location Filters
To change the location filter dynamically, use the `useFeed` hook:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { setLocationFilters } = useFeed();

  const updateLocation = () => {
    setLocationFilters({
      latitude: 40.7128,
      longitude: -74.0060,
      radius: 10000, // 10 km
    });
  };

  const clearLocation = () => {
    setLocationFilters(null); // Removes location filters
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={updateLocation}>Set New Location</button>
      <button onClick={clearLocation}>Clear Location Filters</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Notes
1. **Precision**: Ensure the latitude and longitude values are precise enough for the desired filtering. Slight inaccuracies in coordinates may result in unexpected results.
2. **Radius Limitations**: The radius value determines the size of the filtering area in meters. Be mindful of performance implications when using very large radii.
3. **No Location Filter**: If `setLocationFilters` is set to `null`, the system will ignore location as a filtering criterion when fetching entities.

#### Conclusion
Location Filters provide a powerful way to enhance feed relevance by focusing on geographic proximity. Whether used statically during initialization or dynamically via the `useFeed` hook, this feature enables users to tailor their feeds for a highly localized experience. Combine it with other filters like Keywords or Title Filters for even more precise content curation.
