### Metadata Filters

The **Metadata Filters** in Replyke allow developers to filter entities based on their `metadata` property, which is flexible and can store unstructured data. This filter is highly versatile, enabling fine-grained control over the feed by matching key-value pairs, verifying key existence, and excluding unwanted metadata.

#### **Overview of Metadata Filters**

The `metadataFilters` property can be passed into the `FeedProvider` as an object with the following structure:

```typescript
export interface MetadataFilters {
  includes?: Record<string, unknown>;
  doesNotInclude?: Record<string, unknown>;
  exists?: string[];
  doesNotExist?: string[];
}
```

-   **`includes`**: Specifies key-value pairs that must exist in the entity's `metadata`. Entities must include all specified key-value pairs.
-   **`doesNotInclude`**: Specifies key-value pairs that must not exist in the entity's `metadata`. If any specified key-value pair exists, the entity is excluded.
-   **`exists`**: An array of keys that must exist in the entity's `metadata`, regardless of their value.
-   **`doesNotExist`**: An array of keys that must not exist in the entity's `metadata`.

#### **Dynamically Updating Metadata Filters**

Developers can dynamically update the metadata filters using the `setMetadataFilters` function provided by the `useFeed` hook. This function expects a new `metadataFilters` object or `null` to clear the filters.

```tsx
const { setMetadataFilters } = useFeed();

// Set a filter to include entities with specific metadata
setMetadataFilters({ includes: { category: "tech", featured: true } });

// Reset metadata filters
setMetadataFilters(null);
```

#### **How Metadata Filters Work**

Metadata Filters allow for complex queries that include:

1.  **Key-Value Matching**:
    -   **`includes`**: Filters entities to include those whose `metadata` contains all specified key-value pairs.
    -   **`doesNotInclude`**: Filters entities to exclude those whose `metadata` contains any specified key-value pairs.
2.  **Key Existence**:
    -   **`exists`**: Ensures entities include the specified keys in their `metadata`.
    -   **`doesNotExist`**: Ensures entities do not include the specified keys in their `metadata`.
3.  **Combined Conditions**: Developers can combine these conditions to create sophisticated filtering logic.

#### **Example Use Cases**

##### **1. Passing Static Filters to the FeedProvider**

To set static metadata filters at feed initialization, pass them directly to the `FeedProvider`:

```tsx
<FeedProvider
  metadataFilters={{
    includes: { category: "tech", featured: true },
    doesNotInclude: { deprecated: true },
    exists: ["author"],
    doesNotExist: ["archived"],
  }}
>
  <MyFeedComponent />
</FeedProvider>
```

This setup ensures that the feed includes:

-   Entities where `metadata.category` is "tech" and `metadata.featured` is `true`.
-   Entities where `metadata.deprecated` is not `true`.
-   Entities with a `metadata.author` key.
-   Entities without a `metadata.archived` key.

##### **2. Dynamically Updating Filters Based on User Interaction**

Developers can allow users to refine the feed dynamically using the `setMetadataFilters` function:

```tsx
const { setMetadataFilters, infusedEntities, loadMore } = useFeed();

const applyFilters = () => {
  setMetadataFilters({
    includes: { category: "tech" },
    exists: ["author"],
  });
};

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Filtered Feed</h1>
    <button onClick={applyFilters}>Apply Tech Filters</button>
    <button onClick={() => setMetadataFilters(null)}>Clear Filters</button>
    <ul>
      {infusedEntities.map((entity) => (
        <li key={entity.referenceId}>
          <h2>{entity.title}</h2>
          <p>Metadata: {JSON.stringify(entity.metadata)}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
    <button onClick={loadMore}>Load More</button>
  </div>
);
```

In this example, clicking the "Apply Tech Filters" button updates the feed to include entities categorized as "tech" and with an `author` key in their metadata.

#### **Important Notes**

-   Metadata Filters are powerful for working with unstructured data, allowing highly customized feeds.
-   Filters are applied immediately, and the feed resets to reflect the updated conditions.
-   Passing `null` to `setMetadataFilters` clears all metadata-based filtering.

#### **Conclusion**

Metadata Filters provide a robust mechanism to filter entities based on the `metadata` property. With support for key-value matching, key existence validation, and exclusion conditions, these filters allow developers to implement advanced and highly specific feed customization. Whether setting static filters at initialization or dynamically adjusting them based on user input, Metadata Filters make it easy to tailor the feed to diverse application needs.
