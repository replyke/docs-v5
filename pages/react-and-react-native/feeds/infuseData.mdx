### The `infuseData` Callback

#### **The Challenge**

When Replyke fetches data for a feed, it retrieves only the information it manages internally. While this is sufficient for many applications, there are cases where entities need additional external data to be meaningful.

For example: A product entity might need inventory details from an external inventory management system.

Without a mechanism to merge external data into Replyke’s entities, developers are left with incomplete data objects, limiting the application’s functionality and user experience.

#### **The Solution**

The `infuseData` callback provides a seamless way to integrate external data into entities fetched by Replyke. This function is passed to the `FeedProvider` and is invoked for each entity in the feed. The `infuseData` function:

1.  Receives a `referenceId` for each entity.
2.  Fetches additional data for that entity from an external source (e.g., another database or API).
3.  Merges the fetched data with the entity, creating a complete data object that includes both Replyke-managed and externally sourced information.

This approach ensures that developers can leverage Replyke’s powerful feed capabilities while maintaining access to essential external data.

#### **How It Works**

Internally, the `useInfusedData` hook handles the logic for merging data. For each entity:

-   It checks if the external data for the entity is already cached to avoid redundant fetches.
-   If not, it uses the provided `infuseData` function to fetch the required data.
-   The fetched data is then merged with the entity, and the complete object is returned in the `infusedEntities` array.

The `entities` array remains "pure," containing only the data fetched by Replyke. The `infusedEntities` array provides the enriched versions of these entities.

#### **Example**

Here is a practical example of how to use the `infuseData` callback:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { FeedProvider, useFeed } from 'replyke';

const fetchInventoryData = async (referenceId: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/inventory/${referenceId}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch inventory data');
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching inventory data for ${referenceId}:`, error);
    return null;
  }
};

const ProductFeed = () => {
  const {
    infusedEntities,
    loadMore,
    resetEntities,
    loading,
    hasMore,
  } = useFeed();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product Feed</h1>
      <ul>
        {infusedEntities.map((entity) => (
          <li key={entity.referenceId}>
            <h2>{entity.title}</h2>
            <p>Stock: {entity.infusion.stock}</p>
            <p>Price: ${entity.infusion.price}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {hasMore && <button onClick={loadMore}>Load More</button>}
      <button onClick={resetEntities}>Refresh Feed</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => (
  <FeedProvider infuseData={fetchInventoryData}>
    <ProductFeed />
  </FeedProvider>
);

export default App;

```

#### **Key Takeaways**

-   The `infuseData` callback bridges the gap between Replyke’s feed data and your application’s external data requirements.
-   It ensures that entities can be enriched with external data dynamically.
-   The process is efficient, leveraging caching to minimize redundant fetches.

This feature empowers developers to create rich, data-complete applications while maintaining the flexibility and power of Replyke feeds.
