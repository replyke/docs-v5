## Overview

A **feed** is a powerful and versatile concept in Replyke that represents a stream of entities. It is named "feed" because it "feeds" data to your application, but its uses extend far beyond a traditional social media home feed. Feeds are designed to offer dynamic and flexible access to entities, which can be filtered and sorted based on various attributes, either:

- **Statically**: At the time of initialization, ensuring you have a pre-defined structure or set of results.
- **Dynamically**: At runtime, allowing real-time adjustments based on user input or application state.
- **Both**: Combining static presets with runtime flexibility for ultimate control.

### **Why "Feed"?**

The term "feed" was chosen not to limit its scope but to evoke its fundamental purpose: delivering entities to power your app's functionality. However, a feed is not tied to a specific layout or use case. Instead, it is a flexible tool that adapts to a variety of applications, including but not limited to:

1.  **Home Feeds**: Display a continuous stream of posts, products, or updates.
2.  **User Profiles**: Filter entities by user ID to show only the content created by a specific user.
3.  **Search Functionality**: Use filters like title, content, or keywords to dynamically generate search results.
4.  **Blogging Platforms**: Fetch and display articles in a customized layout, tailored to the platform's design.
5.  **Dating Apps**: Represent each profile as an entity, using the feed to load and refresh a stack of profiles seamlessly.
