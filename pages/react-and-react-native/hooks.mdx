# Overview: Story to Hooks

Welcome to the Hooks section of the Replyke documentation!

So far, you've explored Replyke by following a step-by-step journey, building a socially powered application piece by piece. This story-driven approach has walked you through the essential concepts and features, helping you understand how the core elements fit together seamlessly. You’ve seen how context providers and pre-built functionality simplify much of the heavy lifting when integrating Replyke into your project.

### Why a Dedicated Hooks Section?

While the journey so far has been designed to get you most of the way, Replyke offers a wealth of lower-level utilities that give you even greater control over your application. These utilities come in the form of **hooks**, which are used extensively under the hood in the context providers you’ve been working with.

The purpose of this section is to:

-   Expose the individual hooks available in Replyke.
-   Explain their roles and functionality.
-   Empower you to use them directly when you need more flexibility or custom behavior.

### When Should You Use Hooks Directly?

In most cases, the pre-built context providers will cover your needs. However, there are times when you might need to:

1.  **Extend Functionality:** Add custom logic beyond what the context provider offers.
2.  **Optimize Performance:** Use hooks selectively in parts of your app to avoid overloading context.
3.  **Debug or Enhance:** Access fine-grained control over a feature during development or debugging.

### How This Section is Organized

Each hook will have its own dedicated page with:

-   **Overview:** A concise explanation of what the hook does.
-   **Usage Example:** Code snippets showing the hook in action.
-   **Parameters & Returns:** Detailed information about inputs and outputs.
-   **Common Use Cases:** Scenarios where the hook shines.
-   **Tips & Best Practices:** Advice for leveraging the hook effectively.

### What to Expect

The hooks documented here give you direct access to Replyke’s underlying functionality. This allows for powerful customizations while ensuring you can rely on the stability and performance of the core system. Whether you’re integrating Replyke into an advanced use case or just curious about what’s under the hood, this section will serve as a detailed reference.
