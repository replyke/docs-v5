## Overview

In modern applications, establishing relationships between users, such as the ability to follow or unfollow others, is a cornerstone of personalized and dynamic content. These relationships enable users to curate their experiences by choosing whose content they want to see, fostering community interaction and engagement. By integrating follow relationships, you can enhance your application's functionality, tailoring content feeds to reflect user interests.

Replyke simplifies the implementation of follow relationships with three dedicated hooks. These hooks are designed for ease of use, requiring minimal setup while offering robust functionality.

Unlike many other functionalities, relationships in Replyke do not require any context provider. You can use the relationship hooks directly in your components.
