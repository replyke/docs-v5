### **GIF Integration with GIPHY**

GIFs have become a staple in online communication, adding a layer of expression and fun that plain text simply can’t achieve. With Replyke, integrating GIF support into your app is effortless thanks to our built-in GIPHY integration. Here’s everything you need to know:

#### **How It Works**

-   Replyke uses the GIPHY API to allow users to post GIFs as comments seamlessly.
-   Developers only need to generate a GIPHY API key and set it in their Replyke project dashboard.
-   Once the API key is added in the dashboard, users will see an option to add GIFs when leaving comments.

#### **No API Key? No Problem**

-   If no API key is provided, the GIF button will be hidden in the app's UI.
-   This ensures that the absence of GIF functionality does not negatively impact the user experience or interfere with the design.

#### **Why Add GIF Support?**

1.  **Enhanced User Engagement**  
    GIFs bring conversations to life, making them more dynamic and enjoyable. Whether it’s a funny response, a heartfelt sentiment, or a moment of celebration, a well-placed GIF can elevate the interaction.
    
2.  **Cultural Relevance**  
    With GIFs being widely used across social platforms, offering this feature ensures your app remains modern and aligned with user expectations.
    
3.  **Flexibility for Developers**  
    Adding GIF support is entirely optional. Developers have full control over enabling or disabling it, depending on their app's needs.
    

#### **Setting Up GIF Support**

1.  [Generate a GIPHY API Key](https://developers.giphy.com/) by creating a developer account.
2.  Add the API key to your Replyke project dashboard.

### **Emojis in Your App**

#### **Why Emojis Matter**

Emojis have become a universal language in digital communication, transcending text to convey emotions, tone, and context. Whether it’s a thumbs-up 👍, a laughing face 😂, or a heartfelt ❤️, emojis add personality and richness to interactions, making them an essential feature in any app that supports user-generated content.

Unlike GIFs, emojis are already part of every mobile and desktop keyboard, meaning users can add them to comments without requiring any extra UI elements. However, Replyke goes a step further to encourage their use and make commenting even more engaging.

#### **Emoji Suggestions Bar**

To make it easier and more intuitive for users to add emojis to their comments, Replyke includes a built-in **Emoji Suggestions Bar**. This bar, displayed above the new comment input field, features a selection of commonly used emojis, helping users effortlessly bring more life and emotion into their comments.

#### **How It Works**

-   The Emoji Suggestions Bar is included **by default** in the `NewCommentForm` component, requiring no additional configuration from developers.
-   Users can simply click on their preferred emoji from the bar to add it directly to their comment.

#### **Disabling the Emoji Bar**

If you’d prefer to disable the Emoji Suggestions Bar for your app, it’s as simple as setting a flag:

```jsx
<NewCommentForm withEmojis={false} />
```

With this flag set to `false`, the bar will be hidden, but users can still add emojis using their device’s keyboard.

#### **Why Enable the Emoji Bar?**

1.  **Encourage Expressive Comments**  
    Providing users with a visible selection of emojis makes it more likely that they’ll include them, resulting in comments that feel more expressive and fun.
    
2.  **Quick and Convenient**  
    Users don’t need to switch to their keyboard’s emoji menu—common emojis are right there, just a click away.
    
3.  **Built-In Simplicity**  
    Since the Emoji Bar is integrated into the `NewCommentForm` component, there’s no additional setup required to start using it.
