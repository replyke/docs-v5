### **GIF Integration with GIPHY**

GIFs have become a staple in online communication, adding a layer of expression and fun that plain text simply can‚Äôt achieve. With Replyke, integrating GIF support into your app is effortless thanks to our built-in GIPHY integration. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know:

#### **How It Works**

-   Replyke uses the GIPHY API to allow users to post GIFs as comments seamlessly.
-   Developers only need to generate a GIPHY API key and set it in their Replyke project dashboard.
-   Once the API key is added and the feature is set to "Active" in the dashboard, users will see an option to add GIFs when leaving comments.

#### **No API Key? No Problem**

-   If no API key is provided or the feature is set to "Disabled," the GIF button will be hidden in the app's UI.
-   This ensures that the absence of GIF functionality does not negatively impact the user experience or interfere with the design.

#### **Why Add GIF Support?**

1.  **Enhanced User Engagement**  
    GIFs bring conversations to life, making them more dynamic and enjoyable. Whether it‚Äôs a funny response, a heartfelt sentiment, or a moment of celebration, a well-placed GIF can elevate the interaction.
    
2.  **Cultural Relevance**  
    With GIFs being widely used across social platforms, offering this feature ensures your app remains modern and aligned with user expectations.
    
3.  **Flexibility for Developers**  
    Adding GIF support is entirely optional. Developers have full control over enabling or disabling it, depending on their app's needs.
    

#### **Setting Up GIF Support**

1.  [Generate a GIPHY API Key](https://developers.giphy.com/) by creating a developer account.
2.  Add the API key to your Replyke project dashboard.
3.  Toggle the feature to "Active" to enable it for users.
4.  If needed, switch it to "Disabled" to hide the option entirely.

### **Emojis in Your App**

#### **Why Emojis Matter**

Emojis have become a universal language in digital communication, transcending text to convey emotions, tone, and context. Whether it‚Äôs a thumbs-up üëç, a laughing face üòÇ, or a heartfelt ‚ù§Ô∏è, emojis add personality and richness to interactions, making them an essential feature in any app that supports user-generated content.

Unlike GIFs, emojis are already part of every mobile and desktop keyboard, meaning users can add them to comments without requiring any extra UI elements. However, Replyke goes a step further to encourage their use and make commenting even more engaging.

#### **Emoji Suggestions Bar**

To make it easier and more intuitive for users to add emojis to their comments, Replyke includes a built-in **Emoji Suggestions Bar**. This bar, displayed above the new comment input field, features a selection of commonly used emojis, helping users effortlessly bring more life and emotion into their comments.

#### **How It Works**

-   The Emoji Suggestions Bar is included **by default** in the `NewCommentForm` component, requiring no additional configuration from developers.
-   Users can simply click on their preferred emoji from the bar to add it directly to their comment.

#### **Disabling the Emoji Bar**

If you‚Äôd prefer to disable the Emoji Suggestions Bar for your app, it‚Äôs as simple as setting a flag:

```jsx
<NewCommentForm withEmojis={false} />
```

With this flag set to `false`, the bar will be hidden, but users can still add emojis using their device‚Äôs keyboard.

#### **Why Enable the Emoji Bar?**

1.  **Encourage Expressive Comments**  
    Providing users with a visible selection of emojis makes it more likely that they‚Äôll include them, resulting in comments that feel more expressive and fun.
    
2.  **Quick and Convenient**  
    Users don‚Äôt need to switch to their keyboard‚Äôs emoji menu‚Äîcommon emojis are right there, just a click away.
    
3.  **Built-In Simplicity**  
    Since the Emoji Bar is integrated into the `NewCommentForm` component, there‚Äôs no additional setup required to start using it.
