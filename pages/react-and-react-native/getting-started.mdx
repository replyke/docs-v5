### Create a Project on Replyke’s Dashboard

To start working with Replyke, visit the Replyke Dashboard and create a new project. Once your project is set up, you’ll receive a `projectId`, which you’ll use to initialize Replyke in your app.

### Wrap Your App with the ReplykeProvider

The `ReplykeProvider` component from Replyke should wrap your entire app to provide access to Replyke’s features. Place it at the top level of your application, passing the `projectId` as a prop. Here’s an example:

```javascript
import { ReplykeProvider } from "@replyke/react-js";

<ReplykeProvider projectId={/* Your project ID */}>
  {/* Rest of your app */}
</ReplykeProvider>;
```

With this setup, your app is now ready to leverage Replyke’s powerful features. For further details, explore the specific sections of this documentation tailored to your needs.
