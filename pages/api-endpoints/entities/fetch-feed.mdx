# Fetch Many Entities

## Endpoint

**URL:** `https://api.replyke.com/:projectId/entities/`

**Method:** `GET`

**Authentication Required:** Optional (Authorization token can be included but is not mandatory)

----------

## Description

This endpoint allows fetching multiple entities based on various filters and sorting criteria. It supports optional authentication, meaning it can be accessed with or without an access token. Entities can be filtered by keywords, metadata, content, title, media presence, location, and user-specific preferences (e.g., only fetching posts from followed users). Sorting options include `new`, `top`, `hot`, and `controversial`, and results can be paginated.
