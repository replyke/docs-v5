## Notes

-   If a user has previously downvoted an entity, the downvote is removed when they upvote.
-   If the entity is user-owned, a notification is triggered to notify the owner of the upvote.
-   `upvotes` and `downvotes` are arrays of user IDs representing users who have voted on the entity.
-   Users cannot upvote the same entity multiple times.
