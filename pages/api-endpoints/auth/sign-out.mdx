# Sign Out

## Endpoint

**URL:** `https://api.replyke.com/:projectId/auth/sign-out`

**Method:** `POST`

**Authentication Required:** Yes (Requires a valid refresh token)

----------

## Description

This endpoint allows users to sign out by invalidating their refresh token. While Replyke does not have explicit sign-up or sign-in endpoints, the `verify-external-user` endpoint acts as both a sign-up and sign-in mechanism. Developers must call this endpoint when a user logs out from their app to ensure that the refresh token is invalidated; otherwise, the user may still be considered signed in within the Replyke system.

----------

## Request

### Headers

-   `Content-Type: application/json`

### Body Parameters

| Parameter      | Type   | Required | Description |
|---------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `refreshToken` | `string` | No  | Refresh token (if not provided via cookie). |


----------

## Response

### Success Response (204 No Content)

This endpoint always returns a `204 No Content` response, regardless of whether a refresh token was found and invalidated. There is no response body.

### Error Responses

#### Internal Server Error (500 Internal Server Error)

```json
{
  "error": "Internal server error."
}
```

**Reason:** An unexpected error occurred while processing the request.

## Notes

-   If a refresh token is provided via cookies, it is cleared when this endpoint is called.
-   If a valid refresh token exists in the database, it is deleted to prevent further use.
-   A `204 No Content` response is always returned, even if the token was not found, to prevent information leaks.
-   Developers must call this endpoint when logging a user out to fully terminate their session in Replykeâ€™s authentication system.
