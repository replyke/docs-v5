# User Authentication via JWT

## Endpoint

**URL:** `https://api.replyke.com/:projectId/auth/verify-external-user`

**Method:** `POST`

**Authentication Required:** No (Uses JWT validation)

----------

## Description

This endpoint validates an externally issued JWT and returns authentication tokens for the user. The user must provide a properly signed JWT. If the user exists, their information is updated; otherwise, a new user is created.

----------

## Request

### Headers

-   `Content-Type: application/json`

### Body Parameters

| Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description |
|------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `userJwt` | `string` | Yes | JWT signed by the external project's private key. |


----------

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "accessToken": "<JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
  "refreshToken": "<JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN>",
  "user": {
    "id": "<USER_ID>",
    "email": "<USER_EMAIL>",
    "name": "<USER_NAME>",
    "username": "<USER_USERNAME>",
    "avatar": "<USER_AVATAR>",
    "reputation": "<USER_REPUTATION>"
  }
}
```

**Cookies Set:**

-   `replyke-refresh-jwt`: Refresh token stored as an `HttpOnly` cookie.

### Error Responses

#### Missing `userJwt` (400 Bad Request)

```json
{
  "error": "Missing userJwt"
}
```

**Reason:** The request must include a `userJwt` in the body.

#### Missing JWT Keys (403 Forbidden)

```json
{
  "error": "Missing JWT keys"
}
```

**Reason:** The project has not set up its JWT signing keys in the dashboard. The user must generate and configure them.

#### Invalid Token (403 Forbidden)

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid token"
}
```

**Reason:** The provided JWT could not be verified using the project's public key. This could be due to an expired or incorrectly signed token.

----------

## Notes

-   The JWT must be signed using the project's private key and verified against its stored public key.
-   Ensure the project has configured JWT keys in the dashboard.
-   Refresh tokens are stored in an `HttpOnly` cookie for security purposes.
-   Mobile apps do not support cookies, so the refresh token is returned in the response. It should be stored securely, using tools such as `expo-secure-store` or `react-native-keychain`.
-   Access tokens should be attached to the `Authorization` header of all authenticated requests as `Bearer <accessToken>`.
-   Access tokens are only valid for 30 minutes. After expiration, a new access token must be requested using the refresh token (refer to the separate endpoint in the documentation for this process).
