## Getting Started with the Replyke API

Getting started with Replyke via the API is straightforward. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to integrate Replyke into your application using direct API calls.

<Steps>
### Create a Project on Replyke’s Dashboard

To begin using Replyke, visit the [Replyke Dashboard](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-6777c65195188191a09e07f460009a42-replyke-docs/c/67ade425-614c-8013-82a4-0339b163c6ed#) and create a new project. Once your project is set up, you’ll receive a `projectId`, which you need to save somewhere on the client as it is required for making API requests. It is not secret, but it is always recommended to store such data in environment variables if possible.

### Explore the API

Once your project is set up, you can start using the API to interact with Replyke's features. Most features that require user identity will also require authentication. Refer to the **Authentication Documentation** for details on handling authentication.


### Start Implementing Features

With your project set up, you can now integrate various Replyke features such as:

-   Posting and fetching comments
-   Creating posts
-   Fetching posts for a feed
