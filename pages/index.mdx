# Why Build Communities Around Your Product?

Creating a community around your product can significantly enhance user engagement and retention. Communities encourage discussions, foster loyalty, and give users a reason to return. Features like comments, votes, feeds, and notifications are at the core of these interactions. They help users connect, share ideas, and feel part of something larger.

Building these features from scratch, however, can be time-consuming and repetitive. That’s where Replyke comes in.
